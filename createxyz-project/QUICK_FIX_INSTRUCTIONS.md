# Quick Fix for Google Apps Script CORS Error

## The Problem
Your Google Apps Script has a JavaScript error: `output.setHeaders is not a function`. This happens because Google Apps Script uses `setHeader()` (singular) not `setHeaders()` (plural).

## Quick Solution

### Step 1: Deploy Simple Test Script
1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Open your existing project or create a new one
3. Replace ALL the code with the contents of `google-apps-script-simple.js`
4. Save the project
5. Deploy as web app:
   - Click "Deploy" → "New Deployment"
   - Type: Web app
   - Execute as: Me
   - Who has access: Anyone
   - Click "Deploy"
6. Copy the new web app URL

### Step 2: Test the Simple Version
1. Update the `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL` in your web app with the new URL
2. Test using the "Test GET Connection (Direct)" button
3. If it works, try "Test POST Submission (Direct)"

### Step 3: Upgrade to Full Version (Optional)
Once the simple version works, you can replace it with the corrected full version from `google-apps-script-code.js`.

## What I Fixed
- Changed `output.setHeaders(corsHeaders)` to individual `output.setHeader()` calls
- Simplified the CORS setup for better compatibility
- Added error handling for malformed requests

## Test Results Expected
- ✅ GET request should return: `{"success": true, "message": "GET request successful", ...}`
- ✅ POST request should return: `{"success": true, "message": "POST request successful", ...}`
- ❌ CORS errors should be eliminated

The web app should now work with both the direct fetch method and the standard API calls.
